## Overview

This repository contains the official Fraser Heights Secondary School Integrated Math & Science Academy (FHSS IMSA) logo source files, exports, and organized variants used across publications and digital assets. It stores multiple versions (primary, black/white, inverse) and historical releases in the `archive/` folders.

## Repository structure

- `primary/` — canonical source and export files for the main logo.
- `variants/` — alternate color and layout versions (e.g., `inverse-black-white`).
- `version-current/` — working copy and production-ready set; stable external links point here.
- `version-template/` — clean starting point to seed a new working copy.
- `archive/version-YYYY-MM-DD/` — archived releases (ISO date for ordering).

## Quick usage

- For production-ready exports, check `primary/exports/` or the matching `variants/*/exports/` folders.
- For editable source files, see `primary/source/` or the relevant variant `*/source/` folder.
