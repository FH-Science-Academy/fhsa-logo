## Overview

This repository contains the official FH-Science-Academy (FHSA) logo source files, exports, and organized variants used across publications and digital assets. It stores multiple versions (primary, black/white, inverse) and historical releases in the `archive/` folders.

## Repository structure

- `primary/` — canonical source and export files for the main logo.
- `variants/` — alternate color and layout versions (e.g., `black-white`, `inverse`).
- `version-curent/` and `version-next/` — archived releases and work-in-progress versions.

## Quick usage

- For production-ready exports, check `primary/exports/` or the matching `variants/*/exports/` folders.
- For editable source files, see `primary/source/` or the relevant variant `*/source/` folder.

## Contributing

To create a new version, first move the previous version into the `archive/` folder and append a date stamp to it. Then, duplicate the `version-next/` folder, name it `version-current/` and add changes to it.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not deviate from the `version-current/` naming convention or folder structure as external links rely on it.
> For each version, you must include:
> - `version-current/primary/source/logo-sa.svg`
> - `version-current/primary/exports/logo-sa.svg`
> - `version-current/primary/exports/logo-sa.png`
